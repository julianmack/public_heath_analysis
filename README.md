# Health Data short Data-Science project

### Task Introduction
Health Profiles is a govt. programme to improve availability and accessibility for health and health related information in England. The profiles give a snapshot overview of health for each local authority. Designed to help local government and health services make decisions and plans to improve local people's health and reduce health inequalities, the profiles present a set of health indicators that show how the area compares to the national average. The indicators are carefully selected each year to reflect important public health topics.

Your task is to inform the health authorities on the relations between health indicators and socioeconomic and demographic indicators and create a predictive model. You will need to describe an analysis strategy, process and merge the data from a database, investigate the relations, model a particular relation and describe how you would inform the authorities on possible future outcomes.

See "Task_outline.pdf" for specification and "REPORT.pdf" for short summary of results.
